```typescript
jsonHelpers =
  '\non jsonString(val)\n  if val is "" or val is missing value or val is "missing value" then\n    return "null"\n  else\n    return "\\"" & my escapeJson(val) & "\\""\n  end if\nend jsonString\n\non jsonArray(theList)\n  if (count of theList) is 0 then\n    return "[]"\n  end if\n  set output to "["\n  repeat with i from 1 to count of theList\n    if i > 1 then set output to output & ","\n    set output to output & "\\"" & (my escapeJson(item i of theList)) & "\\""\n  end repeat\n  return output & "]"\nend jsonArray\n\non escapeJson(str)\n  set output to ""\n  set quoteChar to "\\""\n  set bslashChar to "\\\\"\n  set tabChar to tab\n  repeat with c in characters of (str as string)\n    set ch to c as string\n    if ch is quoteChar then\n      set output to output & "\\\\\\""\n    else if ch is bslashChar then\n      set output to output & "\\\\\\\\"\n    else if ch is return then\n      set output to output & "\\\\n"\n    else if ch is linefeed then\n      set output to output & "\\\\n"\n    else if ch is tabChar then\n      set output to output & "\\\\t"\n    else\n      -- Check for other control characters (ASCII 0-31) and skip them\n      set charCode to id of ch\n      if charCode < 32 then\n        -- Skip control characters\n      else\n        set output to output & ch\n      end if\n    end if\n  end repeat\n  return output\nend escapeJson\n';
